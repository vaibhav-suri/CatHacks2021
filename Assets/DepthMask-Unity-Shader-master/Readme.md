# Unity Depth Mask Shader

This simple shader attached to a material is incredibly useful in @unity3d. Anything behind a mesh with it applied will be rendered invisible to your camera.

Combine with multiple cameras for cool masking tricks. Useful for creating fake holes in geometry, UI and AR applications.
 
## Getting Started

Download the shader and put it in your project's Assets/shaders directory. Make a material in Unity and set its shader to DepthMask, and experiment.

Good luck!
